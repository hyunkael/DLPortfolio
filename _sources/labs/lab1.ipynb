    "**Rationale**: Understanding production capacity is essential for planning future supply. This metric helps identify production trends, potential bottlenecks, and whether the company is meeting its manufacturing targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Diagnostic Analytics Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Why did vaccine distribution in certain regions lag compared to others despite equal supply allocations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: This question investigates the root causes of distribution inefficiencies. Factors might include logistical challenges, cold chain infrastructure limitations, administrative delays, or local resistance. Understanding these causes enables targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: What caused the sudden spike in demand for vaccines in urban areas compared to rural areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: Analyzing demand patterns helps understand population behavior and external factors (e.g., media coverage, outbreak clusters, policy changes) that influence vaccination rates. This insight is crucial for resource allocation and communication strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Predictive Analytics Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Based on current vaccination rates, how many people will be fully vaccinated in the next three months?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: This forecast helps plan for future vaccine needs, estimate when herd immunity might be achieved, and adjust public health policies accordingly. It also helps in managing expectations and communicating progress to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: If a new COVID-19 variant emerges, what is the projected demand increase for booster shots?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: Scenario-based predictions enable proactive planning. By modeling different scenarios (e.g., new variants, waning immunity), the company can prepare production capacity and distribution networks in advance, avoiding supply shortages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Prescriptive Analytics Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: If vaccine demand exceeds supply in a specific region, how should the company optimize logistics to ensure equitable distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: This question requires optimization algorithms to determine the best allocation strategy considering multiple constraints (e.g., population density, vulnerability, existing coverage). It provides actionable recommendations for fair and efficient distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: Given current production capacity, what adjustments should be made to meet the projected global vaccine demand within the next six months?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: This prescriptive question considers multiple factors (production capacity, demand forecasts, resource constraints) to recommend specific actions such as increasing shifts, investing in new equipment, or partnering with other manufacturers."

    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this laboratory task, I have gained several important insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **The Analytics Hierarchy**\n",
    "The four types of analytics form a natural progression from simple to complex:\n",
    "- **Descriptive** analytics provides the foundation by answering \"what happened?\"\n",
    "- **Diagnostic** analytics builds on this by explaining \"why it happened?\"\n",
    "- **Predictive** analytics uses patterns to forecast \"what will happen?\"\n",
    "- **Prescriptive** analytics completes the cycle by recommending \"what should we do?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each level builds upon the previous one, increasing in both complexity and business value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Real-World Applications**\n",
    "The COVID-19 vaccine scenario demonstrated how these analytics types work together in practice. In a real-world crisis:\n",
    "- We need to **monitor** the current situation (descriptive)\n",
    "- **Understand** what's driving changes (diagnostic)\n",
    "- **Anticipate** future developments (predictive)\n",
    "- **Optimize** our response (prescriptive)\n",
    "\n",
    "No single type of analytics is sufficient—comprehensive decision-making requires all four.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **The Role of Deep Learning**\n",
    "Deep learning primarily operates in the **predictive analytics** space, but its applications extend to prescriptive analytics when combined with optimization techniques. Neural networks excel at:\n",
    "- Identifying complex patterns in large datasets\n",
    "- Making accurate predictions from historical data\n",
    "- Handling non-linear relationships\n",
    "- Processing multiple types of data (images, text, time series)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Question Formulation is Critical**\n",
    "One of the most important skills I developed through this exercise is the ability to formulate appropriate questions for each analytics type. The quality of insights we can extract is directly related to the quality of questions we ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges Encountered\n",
