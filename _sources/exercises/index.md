# Exercises

This section contains practice exercises that reinforce the theoretical concepts and practical skills learned throughout the Deep Learning course.

## Purpose

Exercises serve to:
- Strengthen understanding of core concepts
- Practice implementing algorithms and techniques
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Prepare for more complex projects
- Build confidence in applying deep learning methods

## Exercise Categories

Exercises are organized by topic:

- **Fundamentals**: Basic concepts in neural networks and deep learning
- **Data Processing**: Techniques for data cleaning, transformation, and augmentation
- **Model Architecture**: Designing and implementing various neural network architectures
- **Optimization**: Training strategies, hyperparameter tuning, and performance optimization
- **Applications**: Domain-specific applications (computer vision, NLP, etc.)

## Coming Soon

Exercises will be added here as the course progresses. Each exercise will include:

- Problem statement and objectives
- Starter code or templates
- Solution with detailed explanations
- Additional challenges for deeper learning
